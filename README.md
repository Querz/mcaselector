## Usage
### Video Tutorials
For people who prefer watching a video to understand how the MCA Selector works, there some very good tutorials on 
YouTube explaining the basics:

* [How To Reset Chunks In Your Minecraft World!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xx8fwynlRs) by [Farzy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVtz3s3FUxVxBgPl2OWtIJQ)
* [How To Clear Unwanted Chunks In Minecraft 1.16 | MCASelector Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADDTXGRJo20) by [Muriako](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpt-MjKkc5X4W7bUFV3Dwrw)
* [Preparing Your World for the Nether Update! - The Minecraft Survival Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fiyVvoD9jQ) starting at [2:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fiyVvoD9jQ&t=2m52s) by [Pixlriffs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgGjBqZZtAjxfpGSba7d6ww)
* [How To Reset The End Dimension! - The Minecraft Survival Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-2gFkJl_Lo) starting at [8:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-2gFkJl_Lo&t=8m45s) by [Pixlriffs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgGjBqZZtAjxfpGSba7d6ww)

### Navigation
Executing the tool, it shows an empty window with a chunk and a region grid. To actually show a world, open a folder 
containing Minecraft Anvil (\*.mca) files. The tool will then render a top-down view of this world that you can zoom 
into and zoom out of by scrolling up and down and that you can move around using the middle mouse button (`Cmd+LMB` 
on Mac OS) or using `WASD`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/7aa44cd77eefd19a56eb8154ad3fe5de26c15941/default.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing chunk and region grid">
</p>

Zooming out far enough disables the selection of single chunks but lets you select entire regions.

### Selections
Upon finishing selecting chunks and regions, they can be deleted or exported using the `Selection`-menu. Exported 
chunks and regions are not deleted from the original world.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/7aa44cd77eefd19a56eb8154ad3fe5de26c15941/selections.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing chunk and region selection export">
</p>

A selection (not the chunks and regions themselves) can also be exported or imported and even be applied to different worlds.

### Chunk filter
The MCA Selector also contains a powerful tool to delete or export chunks and regions by conditions like the data 
version, the time it was last updated, how much time players have spent in this chunk and some more. Multiple of 
these conditions can be used to create a very specific query describing what chunks and regions should be deleted or 
exported.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/7aa44cd77eefd19a56eb8154ad3fe5de26c15941/filter_chunks.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing the chunk filter">
</p>

Because the conditions use internal values used by Minecraft, the following table gives a brief explanation on what 
they do:

| Condition | Type | Description |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Group | - | Groups multiple conditions. |
| Not Group | - | A negated group. |
| DataVersion | int | The DataVersion tag of the chunk. 100-1343 for 1.12.2 and below, 1444 for 1.13 snapshots and above. |
| InhabitedTime | long | The total amount of time in game-ticks players have spent in that chunk. 1 second is ~20 ticks. Also accepts a duration string such as `1 year 2 months 3 days 4 hours 5 minutes 6 seconds`. |
| Timestamp | int | The time a chunk was last saved in epoch seconds. Also accepts a timestamp in the `yyyy-MM-dd HH-mm-ss`-format such as `2018-01-02 15:03:04`. If the time is omitted, it will default to `00:00:00`. |
| LastUpdate | long | The time a chunk was last saved in ticks since world creation. 1 second is ~20 ticks. Also accepts a duration string such as `1 year 2 months 3 days 4 hours 5 minutes 6 seconds`. |
| xPos | int | The location of the chunk on the x-axis in chunk coordinates. |
| zPos | int | The location of the chunk on the z-axis in chunk coordinates. |
| Palette | String | A list of comma (,) separated 1.13 block names. The block names will be converted to block ids for chunks with DataVersion 1343 or below. The validation of block names can be skipped by writing them in single quotes ('). Example: `sand,'new_block',gravel`.|
| Status | String | The status of the chunk generation. Only recognized by Minecraft 1.13+ (DataVersion 1444+) |
| LightPopulated | byte | Whether the light levels for the chunk have been calculated. If this is set to 0, converting a world from 1.12.x to 1.13 will omit that chunk. Allowed values are `0` and `1`. |
| Biome | String/int | One or multiple biome names and IDs, separated by comma (,). For a reference of biome names and IDs, have a look at the [Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_data_values#Biomes). Custom biomes can be specified by using single quotes (') around a biome ID. |
| Entities | String | One or multiple entity names, separated by comma (,). For a reference of entity names, have a look at the [Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_data_values#Entities). Custom entities are supported, though they must be declared in single quotes (') and with their namespace id. |
| Structures | String | One or multiple structure names, separated by comma (,). A list of all valid structure names can be found [here](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector/blob/master/src/main/resources/mapping/all_structures.txt). Custom structures are supported, though they must be declared in single quotes ('). |
| #Entities | int | The total amount of entities in that chunk. |
| #TileEntities | int | The total amount of tile entities in that chunk. |

Fields that allow multiple comma separated values act the same as multiple consecutive filters of the same type with 
single values connected with the `AND` operator.

A string representation of the query is printed in a text field below the query editor. When entering a query into 
this field directly, press `Enter` to parse it into the query editor.

**Notice**
Running the query will check the `.mca`-file's name first if the query would even apply to any chunk in this file 
using the xPos and zPos conditions, as long as the query is built in a way that allows doing this.

### NBT Changer
The NBT Changer modifies the world files directly by changing specific values.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/7aa44cd77eefd19a56eb8154ad3fe5de26c15941/change_nbt.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing the nbt changer">
</p>

You can change the following values:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| LightPopulated | byte | Whether the light levels for the chunk have been calculated. If this is set to `0`, converting a world from 1.12.x to 1.13 will omit that chunk. Allowed values are `0` and `1` |
| DataVersion | int | Allows to change the DataVersion of the chunks. Should be used with extreme care. |
| InhabitedTime | long | This field stores the amount of game-ticks players have spent in a chunk. Impacts the local difficulty. |
| LastUpdate | long | The time in ticks since world creation when the chunk was last saved. |
| Timestamp | int | The time in epoch seconds when the chunk was last saved. |
| Status | String | The status of the chunk generation. Only recognized by Minecraft 1.13+ (DataVersion 1444+) |
| Biome | String/int | A biome name or ID. This sets all biomes of this chunk to a single biome. For a reference of biome names and IDs, have a look at the [Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_data_values#Biomes). Custom biomes can be specified by using single quotes (') around a biome ID. |
| ReplaceBlocks | String | A comma separated list of block replacements in the format `<block-name>=<block-name\|block-nbt>[;<tile-nbt>]`. Custom block names can be specified by surrounding them with single quotes. |
| DeleteEntities | boolean | If set to `1` or `true`, all entities in that chunk will be deleted. |
| DeleteSections | boolean | One or a range of section indices. A range has the format `<from>:<to>`, inclusive. Omitting `<from>` sets the lowest possible value, omitting `<to>` sets the highest possible value. `:` or `true` means _all_ sections. Multiple ranges or single indices can be defined by separating them with a comma. |
| FixStatus | boolean | Will look for chunks that have terrain data, but their `Status` is set to `empty` and set their `Status` field to `full`. Having terrain data but the `Status` set to `empty` can sometimes happen when upgrading the world through a long upgrade path, e.g. from Minecraft 1.12 directly to 1.16. |

Once the field is highlighted in green, the value is considered valid and will be changed. A gray field, no matter 
its content, will be ignored.

A string representation of the to be changed fields is printed in a text field below the editor. When entering a 
field string into this field directly, press `Enter` to parse it into the editor.

For more information about the fields have a look at the chunk format description on [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chunk_format)

### Chunk Editor
When selecting a single chunk, the menu "Edit chunks" becomes available. It allows precise editing of the entire NBT 
structure of that chunk, including poi and entities data. Names and values can be changed, added, deleted or moved 
(via drag & drop).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/7aa44cd77eefd19a56eb8154ad3fe5de26c15941/edit_chunk.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing the NBT editor">
</p>

**Notice** When the NBT editor does not show any data, the cached top-down view might be outdated, and the chunk 
might not exist anymore in the mca files. In that case, clearing the cache will re-render the regions from scratch 
and show the up-to-date top-down view.

### Chunk import
Importing chunks can be easily done by opening the target world first using `File --> Open` and then merging the 
chunks of a second world using `Tools --> Import chunks`. After selecting a folder containing region files, it is 
possible to import the chunks with a bunch of additional options.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/7aa44cd77eefd19a56eb8154ad3fe5de26c15941/import_chunks.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing the chunk import">
</p>

Options:
* **Offset** imports chunks with an offset in chunk coordinates. To convert block coordinates to chunk coordinates, divide them by 16.
* **Overwrite existing chunks** deletes existing chunks and overwrites them with the imported ones.
* **Apply to selection only** imports chunks into the current selection.
* **Sections** defines one, or a range of sections to be imported. A range has the format `<from>:<to>`, inclusive. 
  Omitting `<from>` sets the lowest possible value, omitting `<to>` sets the highest possible value. `:`, `true` or 
  empty means _all_ sections. Multiple ranges or single indices can be defined by separating them with a comma. If a 
  chunk does not already exist at the location, it will be created containing only the specified sections of the 
  imported chunk.

**Notice**
Commands inside of command blocks will not be changed.
Maps will not be updated, because their data is not stored inside region files.

### Copy and Paste
It is possible to copy a selection to the system clipboard and pasting it to a different location in the same world 
or into an entirely different world.
After making a selection, use `Selection --> Copy chunks` or press `Ctrl+C` (`Cmd+C` on Mac). After navigating to 
the location in the world where the copied chunks need to be pasted, use `Selection --> Paste chunks` or press 
`Ctrl+V` (`Cmd+V`on Mac) to display an overlay showing where the clipboard will be imported to. The overlay can be 
moved around by pressing and holding the left mouse button. Press `Ctrl+V` again to import the chunks at the 
selected location. This will open the [Import chunks](#chunk-import) dialog with prefilled values depending on where 
the overlay has been placed.
Copying can be cancelled by pressing `Esc`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/7aa44cd77eefd19a56eb8154ad3fe5de26c15941/copy_paste.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing copy-paste overlay">
</p>

### Swapping chunks
When exactly two chunks are selected, they can be swapped using `Tools --> Swap chunks`. This is useful for 
corrupted region files when Minecraft failed to correctly save the region file index, resulting in scrambled chunks.

### Overlays
To have a better overview of what's happening in your world, MCA Selector gives the option to enable customizable 
overlays. Overlays can display single values per chunk in the form of a color gradient with a minimum and maximum value.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/7aa44cd77eefd19a56eb8154ad3fe5de26c15941/overlays.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing InhabitedTime overlay for Hermitcraft Season 6">
</p>

Overlays can be con figured using `Tools --> Edit overlays`. By pressing the `N` key, it will switch to displaying 
the next overlay type. When pressing `O` while displaying an overlay, it will rotate all overlays of this type. Only 
when all values of an overlay are valid (e.g. minimum < maximum) and it is set to active it will be displayed in the 
main window.

### Caching
The tool creates an image for each region from the provided mca-files. These images are saved separately inside the respective operating system's specific cache folders. Experience showed that a Minecraft world with a size of 10GB resulted in cached image files with a total size of 80-100MB. Caching as many regions as possible significantly improves loading times.
* Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\mcaselector\cache` if `%LOCALAPPDATA%` is set, otherwise `<parent directory of mcaselector.jar>\mcaselector\cache`
* MacOS: `~/Library/Caches/mcaselector`
* Linux: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mcaselector` if `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` is set or the first directory that contains a folder `mcaselector` in `$XDG_CACHE_DIRS` or a new directory called `mcaselector` in the first entry in `$XDG_CACHE_DIRS` is created or if neither `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` nor `$XDG_CACHE_DIRS` is set `~/.cache/mcaselector`.

### Generating an image
MCA Selector is capable of generating an image based on a selection.

### Debugging
If something is not working properly or if you want to see what exactly the MCA Selector is doing, debugging can be 
enabled in the settings. Informative messages and errors will be printed to the console as well as to a log file.
The log file is stored in the following directory and is overwritten after each new start of the program:
* Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\mcaselector\debug.log` if `%LOCALAPPDATA%` is set, otherwise `<parent directory of 
  mcaselector.jar>\mcaselector\debug.log`
* MacOS: `~/Library/Logs/mcaselector/debug.log`
* Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/mcaselector/debug.log` if `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set or the first directory that contains a 
  file `mcaselector/debug.log` in `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` or `mcaselector` in the first entry in `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` or if 
  neither `$XDG_DATA_HOME` nor `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` is set `~/.local/share/mcaselector/debug.log`.

Alternatively, the location of the log file can be viewed by clicking on the link in the settings dialog.

## Supported Versions
The MCA Selector currently supports the following Minecraft versions:

| Minecraft Version | DataVersion |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| 1.2.1 - 1.12.2    | None - 1343 |
| 1.13 - 1.13.2     | 1444 - 1631 |
| 1.14 - 1.14.4     | 1901 - 1976 |
| 1.15 - 1.15.2     | 2200 - 2230 |
| 1.16 - 1.16.5     | 2566 - 2586 |
| 1.17-pre3         | 2719 |

There is no guarantee for worlds generated in a Snapshot version to work, even if it is specified in the table above.
This only represents the current development status towards the next Minecraft release. Old Snapshots of past 
Minecraft releases are not supported.

---
## Headless mode

MCA Selector can be run in a headless mode without showing the UI. Using any command line parameter automatically 
switches to headless mode.

### Filter query

A filter query is a text representation of the chunk filter that can be created in the UI of the program. It is 
shown in the text field below the query editor of the Chunk filter tool.
Example:
```
--query "xPos >= 10 AND xPos <= 20 AND Palette contains \"sand,water\""
```
This will select all chunks that contain sand and water blocks and their x-position ranges from 10 to 20.
As shown, double quotes (") must be escaped with a backslash.

Groups are represented with a pair of parentheses (`(...)`). As with the chunk filter, logical operators are 
evaluated from left to right, and `AND` has a higher precedence than `OR`. In other words, `a AND b OR c AND d AND 
e` is the same as `(a AND b) OR (c AND d AND e)`. It differs from `c AND d AND e OR a AND b` not by the result, but 
by the sequence of tests performed due to [short-circuiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation).

### Change values

The query for changing NBT values in chunks looks slightly different to the filter query. It is a comma (,) 
separated list of assignments.
Example:
```
--filter "LightPopulated = 1, Status = empty"
```
This will set the field "LightPopulated" to "1" and "Status" to "empty". Just like the filter query, the query to 
change values is printed to the console when using the UI in debug mode.

### Using a JRE or JDK with pre-packed JavaFX (the simple way)
The following steps describe a way to run MCA Selector using a JRE or JDK with pre-packed JavaFX.

With zulu JRE-FX:
For Windows:

* Download the JRE-FX-16 from [HERE](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu16.30.15-ca-fx-jre16.0.1-win_x64.zip) into an 
  empty folder.
* Move the previously downloaded `mcaselector.jar` into the same folder. Extract the content of the 
  downloaded .zip file into this folder.
* Hold `Shift` and `right-click` an empty spot in this folder, and choose `Open PowerShell window here`. Type `& ` 
  (with a space at the end), go into the previously extracted folder and drag and drop the `bin\java.exe` file into 
  the PowerShell window. Then complete the command by typing ` -jar ` (with a space both at the beginning and the end), then dragging and dropping the `mcaselector.jar` file and pressing 
  `Enter`.

For MacOS:

* Download the JDK-FX-16 from [HERE](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu16.30.15-ca-fx-jdk16.0.1-macosx_x64.zip) into 
  an empty folder.
* Extract the content of the downloaded .zip file into this folder.
* Press `Cmd+Space`, type `Terminal` and press `Enter`. Go into the previously extracted folder and drag and drop 
  the `zulu-16.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java` into the terminal. Continue to type `-jar ` (with a space at the end) and 
  drag-and drop the `mcaselector-1.16.2.jar` into the terminal as well, the press `Enter`.

For Linux:

* Download the JDK-FX-16 from [HERE](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu16.30.15-ca-fx-jdk16.0.1-linux_x64.tar.gz) 
  into an empty folder.
* Extract the content of the downloaded .tar.gz file into this folder.
* Open your terminal of choice and navigate in the extracted folder into `bin`, then run `./java -jar 
  <path-to-mcaselector-1.16.2.jar>`.

To avoid having to go through this process every time to start MCA Selector, the resulting command can be copied 
into a `.bat`-file on Windows or `.sh`-file on MacOS and Linux and can then be executed by double-clicking the 
`.bat`-file on Windows or running `sh <file>.sh` in the terminal / console on MacOS or Linux where `<file>` must be 
replaced by the name of the `.sh`-file.

### When you receive an error from a previously installed version of Java
"When I run `mcaselector-1.16.2.jar`, an error dialog appears that looks like this:"

</p>

Open the console or terminal on your OS.

For Windows:
* Hold `Shift` and Right-click on an empty space on your desktop and select `Open PowerShell here` (`Open Command 
  window here` on Windows 8 and earlier).

For MacOS:
* Press `Cmd+Space`, type `Terminal` and press `Enter`.

Type the command `java -version` and press `Enter`. If the output shows that your java command is linked to a Java 
version older than 16, make sure that you have Java 16 installed or proceed with [Using a JRE or JDK with pre-packed 
JavaFX (the simple way)](#using-a-jre-or-jdk-with-pre-packed-javafx-the-simple-way).

For Windows and MacOS:
* Type `java -jar ` (with a space at the end) and drag and drop the `mcaselector-1.16.2.jar` into the console and 
  hit `Enter`.

For Linux:
* Run `java -jar <path to mcaselector-1.16.2.jar` where you replace everything in `<>`.

For Windows:
* Download "JavaFX Windows SDK" for your Java version from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
* Unzip the `.zip`-file with your program of choice, then navigate into the unzipped folder.
* Hold `Shift` and Right-click on an empty space in that folder and select `Open PowerShell window here` (`Open 
  Command window here` on Windows 8 and earlier). Type `java --module-path ` (with a space at the end), then drag 
  and drop the `lib`-folder into the console. Continue to type ` --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH -jar ` (with a space 
  at the beginning and the end), then drag and drop the `mcaselector-1.16.2.jar` into the console and hit `Enter`.

For MacOS:
* Download "JavaFX Mac OS X SDK" for your Java version from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
* Double-click the `.zip`-file to unpack, then navigate into the unzipped folder.
* Press `Cmd+Space`, type `Terminal` and press `Enter`. Type `java --module-path ` (with a space at the end), then 
  drag and drop the `lib`-folder into the console. Continue to type `--add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH -jar ` (with a 
  space at the end), then drag and drop the `mcaselector-1.16.2.jar` into the console and hit `Enter`.

For Linux:
* Download "JavaFX Linux SDK" for your Java version from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
* Unzip the `.zip`-file with your program of choice.
* Open the command prompt and run `java --module-path <path to unzipped folder>/lib --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH 
  -jar <path to mcaselector-1.16.2.jar>` where you replace everything in `<>` with the appropriate paths.
* Some distributions like AdoptOpenJDK (shipped with most Linux distributions) do not ship with JavaFX by default. 
  On Debian, an open version of JavaFX is contained in the `openjfx` package. This or some other installation of 
  JavaFX is required to run the `mcaselector-1.16.2.jar`.

To avoid having to go through this process every time to start MCA Selector, the resulting command can be copied 
into a `.bat`-file on Windows or `.sh`-file on MacOS and Linux and can then be executed by double-clicking the
`.bat`-file on Windows or running `sh <file>.sh` in the terminal / console on MacOS or Linux where `<file>` must be 
replaced by the name of the `.sh`-file.
